    p Cambridge is home to possibly THE coolest Oxfam shop in the land: Oxfam on Mill road. 
    p Since helping out, I've been asked to create artwork to market certain offers and opportunities in store.
    p When designing for Oxfam Mill Road, I like to create something a bit fun and quirky to match the atmosphere of the shop itself. And I'm happy to say the team were pleased with the results!
