    .Project-subTitle Exhibition Print Collateral

    p The Cambridge Art Salon nurtures art and creative ideas created by the public, for the public. For much of March 2014, the Art Salon is holding female-focused exhibitions, in celebration of International Womenâ€™s Day.
    p The Rebel Women, Inspirational Girls exhibition was in conjunction with local charity
      a(href="http://www.romseymill.org/" target="_blank")  Romsey Mill
      |  who had worked for a year with teenage girls in the local area, exploring female role models.
    p With this in mind, I wanted the design for this exhibition to reflect fearlessness, positivity and determination, all underpinned by a strong sense of femininity.
    p The design included a 20 page A5 booklet, double-sided A4/A5 fliers, Vinyl stickers and A3 wall mounts.
